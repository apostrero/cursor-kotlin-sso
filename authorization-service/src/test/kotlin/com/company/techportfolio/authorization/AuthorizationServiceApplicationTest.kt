/**
 * Integration test for the Authorization Service Spring Boot application.
 *
 * This test class verifies that the complete Spring Boot application context
 * can be loaded successfully without errors. It serves as a smoke test to
 * ensure that all beans can be created, dependencies are satisfied, and
 * the application configuration is valid.
 *
 * The test uses the "test" profile to ensure it runs with test-specific
 * configuration, typically including H2 in-memory database and other
 * test optimizations.
 *
 * Test coverage:
 * - Spring Boot application context loading
 * - Bean creation and dependency injection
 * - Configuration validation
 * - Database connectivity (with test profile)
 * - Service discovery configuration
