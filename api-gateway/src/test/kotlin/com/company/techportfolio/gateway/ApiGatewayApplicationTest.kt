/**
 * Integration test class for the ApiGatewayApplication.
 * 
 * This test class verifies that the Spring Boot application context loads correctly
 * and all components are properly configured and wired together. It serves as a
 * smoke test to ensure the application can start without configuration errors.
 * 
 * Test coverage includes:
 * - Spring Boot application context loading
 * - Bean configuration and dependency injection
 * - Configuration properties validation
 * - Component scanning and auto-configuration
 * - Integration between hexagonal architecture layers
 * 
 * Testing approach:
 * - Uses Spring Boot test framework
 * - Loads full application context
 * - Uses test profile for isolated testing
 * - Validates application startup and configuration
 * - Ensures all components are properly wired
