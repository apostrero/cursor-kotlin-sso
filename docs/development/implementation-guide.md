    every { portfolioRepository.save(any()) } returns Mono.just(portfolio)
    
    // When
    val result = portfolioService.createPortfolio(request)
    
    // Then
    StepVerifier.create(result)
        .expectNextMatches { response ->
            response.name == request.name
        }
        .verifyComplete()
    
    verify { eventPublisher.publish(any<PortfolioCreatedEvent>()) }
}

// Reactive Controller Test
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles = ["USER"])
fun `createPortfolio should return 201 when portfolio is created successfully`() {
    // Given
    val request = CreatePortfolioRequest(...)
    every { portfolioService.createPortfolio(any()) } returns Mono.just(response)
    
    // When & Then
    webTestClient.post()
        .uri("/api/v1/portfolios")
        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
